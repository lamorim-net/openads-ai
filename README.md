## What is OpenAds?

OpenAds is an **open-source CLI tool** that turns any AI model into a marketing assistant. It's built for performance marketers, media buyers, and growth leads who want to audit campaigns, write ad copy, and build strategies — all from one place.

**No code. No prompt engineering. No spreadsheet exports.**

### Why use it?

| Feature | What it means for you |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Pre-built marketing skills** | The AI already knows Google Ads best practices, Meta creative formats, CRO frameworks, and copywriting rules. You just ask. |
| 🔌 **Direct platform access** | Connect your Google Ads, Google Analytics (GA4), and Meta accounts. The AI reads your live data — no more copy-pasting reports. |
| 🤖 **Bring your own model** | Use Google Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, or a local model running on your machine. Your choice. |
| 🛡️ **Nothing goes live without you** | The AI can read freely, but every write operation (campaign change, budget edit) requires your explicit approval. |
| ⚡ **Autonomous loops** | Let the AI research competitors, test ad variants, and generate hypotheses overnight. Review in the morning. |

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 👶 New to the terminal? Start here!

OpenAds is a local desktop application that runs in your computer's **Terminal** (a text-based window where you can run commands). Follow these simple steps to get started:

#### Step 1: Install Node.js (Required)
OpenAds runs on your computer using Node.js. If you don't have it yet, installing it is just like any normal application:
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and click the **LTS (Recommended)** button to download it.
2. Open the downloaded file and run the installer (just click "Next" until it finishes).

#### Step 2: Open your Terminal
* **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Space` (Spotlight search), type **Terminal**, and press `Enter`.
* **Windows:** Press the `Windows Key` on your keyboard, type **cmd** (Command Prompt), and press `Enter`.

#### Step 3: Install OpenAds
Copy the command below, paste it into your Terminal window, and press **Enter**:
```bash
npm install -g openads-ai
```
> 💡 **Permissions Error?** If your Terminal shows a red error about "EACCES" or permissions, copy and paste this command instead:
> `sudo npm install -g openads-ai` (Mac will ask you to type your computer password and press Enter).

#### Step 4: Run the Setup Wizard
Paste this command into your Terminal and press **Enter**:
```bash
openads setup
```
This launches a beautiful, step-by-step interactive setup wizard where you can:
* **Select your favorite AI model** (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, or a free local model)
* **Link your ad accounts** (Google Ads, GA4, and/or Meta Ads)
* **Describe your business** (so the AI writes copy tailored exactly to your brand)

#### Step 5: Start using OpenAds!
Whenever you want to audit your campaigns or write copy, just open your Terminal, type:
```bash
openads
```
and press **Enter** to open your dashboard.

## 💡 What can I do with it?

Here are some real examples — just type what you need:

### Ads
| You type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Audit my Google Ads account and flag budget waste` | Reads your live campaign data, finds underperforming keywords, and tells you where you're losing money. |
| `My Meta ROAS dropped 30% this week — what changed?` | Pulls your Meta Ads data, compares to the prior period, and pinpoints what shifted. |
| `Write a 30-second video ad script for TikTok` | Generates a hook → story → CTA script formatted for vertical video with platform-specific timing. |

### Copywriting
| You type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Write 5 Google Ads headlines for my product` | Generates headlines under 30 characters using your product context, with multiple creative angles. |
| `Rewrite this landing page to be more persuasive` | Applies PAS/AIDA frameworks, tightens the copy, and fixes benefit vs. feature balance. |

### Strategy
| You type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Build a go-to-market plan for my Q3 launch` | Produces a structured GTM playbook covering positioning, channels, budget, and timelines. |
| `Who are my top 3 competitors and what are they saying in their ads?` | Analyzes competitor positioning, identifies messaging gaps, and recommends differentiation angles. |
| `Research my target audience for a B2B SaaS product` | Builds a customer research brief: pain points, buying triggers, objections, and voice-of-customer language. |

### Optimization
| You type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `My landing page converts at 1.2% — how do I improve it?` | Runs a CRO audit: checks message match, CTA placement, form length, and gives prioritized fixes. |
| `Set up an A/B test for my signup page headline` | Designs a proper experiment with hypothesis, control vs. variant, sample size, and success criteria. |
| `Run autoresearch on my ad headlines overnight` | The AI autonomously generates variants, scores them, keeps the best, and reports back in the morning. |

### Post-Click
| You type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Write a 5-email welcome sequence for new signups` | Creates a full drip sequence: delivery → value → story → objection handling → soft pitch. |

## 🧠 Memory — Gets Smarter Every Session

OpenAds remembers what it learns about your business. After each conversation, the AI appends key insights to a plain markdown file at `~/.openads/context/my-business.md`:

- Your best-performing campaigns and creative angles
- Audience segments and buying triggers
- Budget constraints and seasonal patterns
- Competitor insights and positioning gaps

You can open and edit this file anytime — it's your data, not a black box. The longer you use OpenAds, the better its advice gets.

---

## ⏰ Scheduled Automations

Set up automated campaign checks that run in the background — no server required.

```bash
openads schedule
```

| Preset | Frequency |
|---|---|
| 📊 Daily campaign health check | Every day at 8 AM |
| 💸 Budget pacing alert | Every 6 hours |
| 📉 Performance drop alert | Twice daily (9 AM & 5 PM) |
| 📋 Weekly performance report | Every Monday at 9 AM |
| ⏰ Custom (describe in plain English) | You choose |

Reports are saved to `~/.openads/reports/` in both Markdown and premium HTML dashboard formats. You can view, list, and open your reports directly:

```bash
openads report            # List all generated reports
openads report [name]     # Open a beautiful HTML dashboard in your browser
```

Manage your schedules:

```bash
openads schedule          # Open the schedule manager
openads schedule list     # See active schedules
openads schedule remove   # Remove a schedule
```

Uses your OS scheduler (macOS `launchd` / Linux `crontab`) — works even when your terminal is closed.

## 🛡️ Dual-Mode Safety (Audit vs. Launch)

To align with our **Radical Simplicity & Safety by Default** principles, OpenAds operates in two visual modes to give you total control and peace of mind over your ad accounts:

* **Audit Mode (Safe / Read-only — Recommended)**: Strict read-only guidelines. The AI can pull live campaign statistics, analyze keywords, find budget waste, and recommend landing page optimizations, but is entirely blocked from making active changes.
* **Launch Mode (Read-Write)**: Active campaign changes. Authorizes write modifications (e.g. pausing campaigns, scaling bids, altering budgets, or testing ad creative) but strictly mandates a clear visual preview card and an explicit **confirmation prompt (Y/N)** before executing.

Configure your default mode anytime by running `openads setup`.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Runs 100% locally.** OpenAds is not a cloud service. Nothing leaves your machine except the API calls you authorize.
- **No telemetry.** We don't track usage, store data, or phone home.
- **Your keys stay on disk.** API keys and tokens are saved to `~/.openads/` on your hard drive. They never touch our servers.
- **Explicit approval for all writes.** The AI previews every campaign change before execution. Nothing goes live without your `Y`.

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

Run the built-in diagnostics to check your setup:

```bash
openads doctor
```

This verifies your config file, API keys, platform connections (live token checks), and required tools like `uvx`.

## Our Principles

1. **Radical Simplicity** — Non-technical marketers must feel at home. No forcing users to learn code, prompt engineering, or API error messages.
2. **Marketers First** — We design around marketing workflows (audits, copy, analysis), not software concepts.
3. **Safety by Default** — AI should never spend money or publish campaigns without human approval.
